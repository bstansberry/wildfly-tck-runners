== WildFly Preview Notes
Currently a fork of the wildfly repo contains the changes being tested. It is https://github.com/starksm64/wildfly.git

A PR to integrate those changes is:
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/15464

This is a trimmed down version of the Weld jboss-tck-runner that focuses on just running the CDI Lite related tests required for the Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile
