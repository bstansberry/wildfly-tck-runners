== Bleeding Edge

If you are developing the Core Profile TCK, then you will rely on snapshot builds of:

* https://github.com/jakartaredhat/core-profile-tck.git - The Jakarta Core Profile TCK candidate repo
* https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly.git - wildfly with latest EE10 changes. Use the wildfly/ee-9/dist/target/wildfly-preview-x.y.z.q-SNAPSHOT local build root as your JBOSS_HOME directory
