== WildFly Preview Notes
Currently a fork of the wildfly repo contains the changes being tested. It is https://github.com/starksm64/wildfly.git

A PR to integrate those changes is:
https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly/pull/15464

This is a trimmed down version of the Weld jboss-tck-runner that focuses on just running the CDI Lite related tests required for the Jakarta EE 10 Core Profile

This current relies on snapshot builds of:
* https://github.com/jakartaredhat/core-profile-tck.git - integration test
* https://github.com/starksm64/wildfly - wildfly fork with BCE changes
* https://github.com/resteasy/resteasy.git (couldl probably use wildfly ee-9 version)
* https://github.com/wildfly/wildfly-arquillian.git (just for extra debugging)
